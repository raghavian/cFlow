### What is this repository for? ###

* Train the proposed model on LIDC and Retina datasets
* Reproduce the reported numbers in the paper
* v1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Basic Pytorch dependency
* Tested on Pytorch 1.3, Python 3.6 
* Download preprocessed LIDC dataset [from here](https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/BgFgw4NMf4). **Change the file name with .zip after downloading. **

### Usage guidelines ###

* Kindly cite our publication if you use any part of the code
